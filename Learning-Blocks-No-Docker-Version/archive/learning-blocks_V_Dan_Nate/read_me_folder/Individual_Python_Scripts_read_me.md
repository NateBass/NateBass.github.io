## Aeries
 This is program was primarily designed to gain access to Aeries databases; However, in order to access anything other than demo data from Aeries it requires a data agreement with school district so that they can generate an API key in order to get access to their system.

Aeries has a "sandbox" mode that allows development without accessing to sensitive data:
- AERIES-CERT: 477abe9e7d27439681d62f4e0de1f5e1
- How to build a request: https://support.aeries.com/support/solutions/articles/14000113681-aeries-api-building-a-request
- Aeries API Documentation: https://support.aeries.com/support/solutions/14000072323

## Alma
 Alma has a sandbox that you can mess around with, documentation can be found at: https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/alma/apis/

## Sensitivities

The apis provide access to data that has PI.  We need to be very sensitive of this data and not download it.  Ideally developer only have access to a sandbox and never have access to sensitive data.  The end users of this tool should be the only ones with sensitive data access.
