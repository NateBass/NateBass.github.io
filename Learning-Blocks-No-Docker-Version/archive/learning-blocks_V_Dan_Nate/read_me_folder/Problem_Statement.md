## Problem Statement

Grant programs have a need to report to the government on their students.  They have a need to gather data from school districts in order to form the reports.  There are a few systems in schools that are used to gather this inforation like PowerSchool and Aeries.  We need to use their apis to programmatically gather this information into csv format so that it can be used to generate reports in Cobro Compass.
