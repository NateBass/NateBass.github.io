# Read Me Guide 
The following is a guide to navigating the different read me files for this project:

## Web_Based_Service
This project has moved into a web based service, with the intent of using a Vue.js version 3 [front-end](https://github.com/code4sac/learning-blocks/tree/main/frontend) and a [python back end](https://github.com/code4sac/learning-blocks/tree/main/backend). For documentation on the web-based service please read [web_based_read_me](https://github.com/code4sac/learning-blocks/blob/main/read_me_folder/web_based_read_me.md). 


## Individual_Scripts
The project orginally started off as a series of scripts and modules that can be found [here](https://github.com/code4sac/learning-blocks/tree/main/Individual%20Python%20Scripts) . However if you want to build  individual scripts own you can use [this](https://github.com/code4sac/learning-blocks/blob/main/read_me_folder/Individual_Python_Scripts_read_me.md) documentation
