# SCHOOL_GRANT_DATA 

## Problem Statement

Grant programs have a need to report to the government on their students.  They have a need to gather data from school districts in order to form the reports.  There are a few systems in schools that are used to gather this inforation like PowerSchool and Aeries.  We need to use their apis to programmatically gather this information into csv format so that it can be used to generate reports in Cobro Compass.

This project has moved into a web based service, with the intent of using a Vue.js version 3 front-end and a python back end.  For documentation on Vue.js sign up to:

FRONT-END DOCUMENTATION:
-"Introduction to Vue 3"  at https://frontendmasters.com/courses/vue-3/ 

-"Vue js + Python" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSawG4dxx2k

-"Host your Python Static site for FREE with Netlify" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcMnJOsMYuM


Hold demo data in the front end title it "json" so that we can query it. How do you save it to local storage or check if it is already in cache. Maybe create a method to but random lettering at teh end of the name of the file so that you wouldnt have to keep checking cache. This would mean the user would have to delete their cache more often.
